**The Mysterious Gear Chest**

a point'n'click adventure game, developed for AdvJam2022

Why there's an ancient Chest behind a door that wasn't? Why a small golden object is found just outside the ISS? 
And why do some odd groups of people do a lot of odd things, in MODENA, Italy?

​A game about Museums, Libraries, and Books (with Gods, Witches and astronauts involved too)

** The Story ** 

Marco is waiting for a real photographer (!) to start his career as a journalist, Sara is enjoying the presence of Enrica, one distant cousin she never heard about, and Andrea is attending a writing course (and then a book presentation) with a local writer he admires. They're teens and friends, and they'll probably see each other later for a drink. What EVER can go wrong, with this background?
​Well, it just depends on what's the mystery behind a quite impressive Gear Chest and why a lot of odd people (and Gods?) want something by it

**Do you need hints to finish the game?**

Even if the game is not too long, it doesn't mean you can't be stuck somewhere - because of you or more probably because of me - because I couldn't make everything clear enough. 
To help you finish the game - if you want to do that - I've written some notes - trying to be not too obvious, but helpful anyway. 
I've used a question-answer approach - and I've put things in order. So you can read the questions, and see if it's related to something you care.
