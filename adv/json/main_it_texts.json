"Let's see"
,"it works! _ feather's burned"
,"Hey! my bed!"
,"That's perfect _ let's take it"
,"So we got a working piece of the puzzle now!"
,"Ok _ yes _ send me your free products home"
,"Are you still here?"
,"Si'?"
,"I hope you're now in love with the Gear Chest _ so be ready to write a great article _ and feel free to come back anytime you want today _ if you want to see it again and again"
,"Grazie?"
,"Where did you find the Gear Chest?"
,"Right here!"
,"In Modena?"
,"Even better! _ Our teams found it inside this same building!"
,"Isn't this building at most 3-400 years old?"
,"That's correct!"
,"How can you find something 2000 years old inside a 400 years old building?"
,"With an expert team!"
,"Where exactly did you find the Gear Chest?"
,"I mean, hidden behind a wall? underground?"
,"Better! _ We found it in the room at the end of this corridor!"
,"The undiscovered Gear Chest was over there? _ all the time?"
,"That's right! _ The greatest discovery of all the time _ and it was done by optimizing the efforts!"
,"Why is this the greatest discovery ever?"
,"Because it's unique _ it's a complex chest _ covered also by writings from an unknown alphabet _ and with a lot of inexplicable images"
,"Some elements seem _ like IKEA instructions _ they should be real because we cannot understand them at all"
,"Are you sure this is something really important?"
,"in which archaeological specialization did you graduate?"
,"Fair point"
,"Thanks for your information"
,"You're Welcome! _ Write a great article!"
,"Please enter the next room _ you'll find our expert that will let you take pictures _ and give you all the detailed information you may need"
,"It's better if I don't go too far _ I want to be there when the presentation starts"
,"Why are YOU wearing glasses?"
,"To see better?"
,"Uh _ never thought about that _ I do that to look cool"
,"Cause they make me look cool!"
,"Do you have an extra sunglasses set to spare?"
,"Mmh... you would indeed look cooler with sunglasses"
,"But I don't have a set to share _ and you won't find them around _ nice idea anyway"
,"Hello! _ I finally found you my dear _ the KULT Underground journalist sent for the Gear Chest event _ it's been an intriguing task"
,"Uh?"
,"Hello old chap _ I was curious to see if you were still around _ nice to know you are"
,"Ah _ hello Bac..."
,"My name's at the moment is Nic"
,"Sure _ hello Nic _ how bad the situation is?"
,"Bad _ but I'll hope to know more soon _ thanks to you"
,"Do you know each other, then?"
,"No"
,"No, never seen this guy before"
,"Ma..."
,"In the name of messages and messengers here is what was intended for you"
,"We'll probably see around"
,"Did you see that?"
,"Cosa?"
,"He VANISHED!"
,"I didn't notice that _ but here we are _ now you've got your pass!"
,"Hello! _ here we are again my dear _ the signer of the presence register of the Gear Chest event _ finding you is getting easier"
,"This time I've got an invitation _ urgent and pressing, but a simple invitation, for now, _ to see nothing less than a General!"
,"Bye! _ and bye also to you, Nic"
,"bye Her..."
,"I'm Ermes here _ without the initial consonant"
,"bye Ermes, then"
,"Did you..."
,"Nope _ I didn't notice he disappeared sorry"
,"This delivery service is quite impressive"
,"Hi, stop"
,"today the whole Palace is reserved for a private presentation"
,"only allowed guests can go in _ sorry"
,"here you are"
,"Good _ I'll take it and you're free to go _ entering and leaving at will _ till the end of today"
,"enjoy the presentation and give Museums Palace a well-deserved press _ or not _ I don't really care as long as you're legit"
,"Hi Marco"
,"Ciao"
,"Hi Sara"
,"I have a bit of a situation here _ look at the door _ my cousin blocked that door handle with an amber-like material _ I can't really imagine how she was able to do that!"
,"Amber material?"
,"You're the second person today who talks to me about amber"
,"And my computer is in that room _ I can't help you _ or do my work _ if I can't break in"
,"I've no idea how to do that"
,"I know _ I'm just taking it out _ I don't expect you can revert that thing"
,"The only thing you could do is to track her down _ and force them to open that door"
,"Eh?"
,"I'm just taking it out, don't worry"
,"But _ have you got pictures? _ I'm curious to see that famous Gear Chest"
,"Check your mobile _ I've asked Nic to send one directly to your mail address"
,"I have some odd things to tell you too"
,"I've met an odd girl at the Museums Palace that plays mind tricks..."
,"She can't be odder than my cousin"
,"She's cool _ gothic style"
,"Uh _ she may BE my cousin after all _ ask her to come back when you see her again!"
,"By the way, Nic said that she's using something called 'Medusa's eye' _ for her trick"
,"So... have you got a mirror?"
,"Did you find a portable mirror you could spare?"
,"A handbag mirror can be fine?"
,"That would be perfect!"
,"Here you are"
,"I'm sorry _ I don't have anything at hand _ but I can check"
,"What do you think we should do?"
,"Not sure _ I'm still thinking about it"
,"I may have found a scheme for how to operate on the gears _ take it _ and see if you can do something with that"
,"What's your plan?"
,"I stay here _ ready to do research with my computer _ and you do the leg work"
,"I stay here _ hoping my cousin comes back _ then I'll try not to kill her"
,"Some random Time cover _ mum's gift once I said to her I want to be a journalist"
,"I don't want to go there now _ I need to attend the event for my article"
,"I don't want to go there now _ I still miss some good pictures for my article"
,"I don't want to go there now _ I need to get the missing pass _ and I doubt that I'll find it wandering around"
,"Hey _ I'll be around in case you need more pictures _ but I'll wait in the pub if you don't mind _ ok?"
,"Sure, thanks"
,"Can you take some pictures?"
,"Can you take some more pictures?"
,"Uh? _ ah! _ yes, sure"
,"Sure"
,"Don't come too near"
,"Stop there"
,"Done. But it's not as good as I hoped"
,"That's a shame"
,"An article without a great picture _ is like something with only a lot of words"
,"Are you sure you want to be a journalist?"
,"Good _ I've taken several great pictures I guess _ I'll check them and I'll send the best one to you by mail"
,"That's perfect _ I guess I'm more or less ready then for my article"
,"Can you send it a copy also to sara.fabbri@truedevs.it? _ she's a friend who'll help me with paginating the article"
,"I don't think you know how a web magazine works _ but that's fine for me _ I'll do that too"
,"She's not really good as she thinks to be"
,"As always I can't get if you're joking or not"
,"She's using the power given her by an object _ one that I know"
,"An object?"
,"She's got a necklace _ with a micro fragment of Medusa's eyes"
,"They're not really her eyes _ don't worry _ it's a stone _ but it works _ even if not as lores told"
,"You found the key cast of the key and a way to use amber _ interesting _ but not worrying"
,"That's unexpected _ nobody was able to find it as far as I know _ that, if combined starts to be worrying _ a little at least"
,"Someone must have found also the Gear Chest replica _ that's a powerful artifact _ even if not dangerous _ we'd like to have it locked away _ who's got it?"
,"A General?"
,"Good to know _ anyway _ Golden key is important but not critical"
,"Someone took a fragment of what was used to create the Chest _ who's this time?"
,"Gothic girls?"
,"Wicca _ probably _ interesting _ but not worrying"
,"Ok, now let's remove the Play ID from the badge _ and put the KULT logo"
,"Nice! _ Now I feel like I'm a real journalist _ almost"
,"Marco, go to talk to Andrea now _ and ask him about his drawings!"
,"Marco, there's something quite odd happening _ the inscriptions on the Chest are too similar to some of Andrea's drawings to not mean something _ go and talk to him as soon as you cane"
,"Uh _ ok _ I'll do that"
,"Ha ha ha _ nice try _ now step back"
,"it doesn't seem useful"
,"Samuele doesn't like people using mobiles _ better use them when he's not around"
,"I could try to send my story to Sara _ she reads a lot and she's usually quite direct in her opinions _ let's do that"
,"Done"
,"I don't have a call to make now"
,"Let's check the bibliography _ yes _ 'Forgotten Gods', by two authors indicated only with the initial letters _ published by KULT Virtual Press in 1945"
,"Now I know what to ask the librarian"
,"Nope _ this thing is dangerous"
,"I should mix them directly on the crack"
,"It's a cheap Modena downtown map"
,"Ehm... he's right here in front of me _ I won't call him now"
,"Hello? I'm Marco"
,"Do you have what I asked you to get?"
,"Not yet"
,"call ends"
,"It's better if I call him at the right minute _ Marco will ask me to do that"
,"This invitation doesn't really seem too friendly _ but maybe he's heard about my journalist skills _ and he wants me for an interview or something"
,"And after all the Military Academy is a ten-minute walk from my home _ simply going right and then left"
,"It's an invitation from Gen. Raimondi _ it says 'COME!' _ followed by the Military Academy address"
,"It's a stuff pass for Play Game Festival"
,"It's quite professional _ I wonder if I could use its frame with a KULT logo inside _ and be more convincing"
,"But I have to find a way to have a KULT logo to use with that"
,"Yes _someone called Nic sent me a great picture of a Stone Chest with a lot of gears _ hundreds of gears! _ it seems scary!"
,"Uh _ in the picture I can also see some inscriptions _ on a lateral part of the chest _ they're QUITE similar to the ones I've seen in Andrea's chapter! _ that can't be a coincidence"
,"Uh _ Andrea sent me the initial chapters of the novel is working on _ at last! _ I was so curious to read it but he's so shy sometimes"
,"Uh _ it's a supernatural text _ it's good! _ he surely got me! _ I'll tell him when I'll see it later on today"
,"Ah _ he's also made some freehand drawings for some descriptive part of the last chapter so far _ some very odd alphabet"
,"Uh _ Andrea's drawings are QUITE similar to the ones I've seen in Nic's picture! _ that can't be a coincidence"
,"It's a letter from Museums Palace _ with 'TOP SECRET STUFF' as send address"
,"I'm not sure I should open it and read it _ it's not mine _ but as long as I've stolen it _ I guess it's not such a dilemma"
,"Let's see..."
,"'Done. As you asked _ I've been able to block the communications _ to all the important and not-so-important media _ glory to our Golden Cause!'"
,"Not a chance I can understand what's this about _ let's get rid of it"
,"Uncle doesn't seem any better than last year _ this time he's talking about a statue with a broken eye _ that's connected with an evil Greek God resurrecting _ last year it was a Sumerian one if I'm not wrong"
,"uncle's talking about a statue with a broken eye _ that's connected with an evil Greek God resurrecting"
,"The statue point seems oddly similar to what Andrea said _ ah _ here there's also the name of the Greek God _ Chaotiki-Kako _ usually shorted as Chako _ never heard of him _ but my Greek knowledge is mainly from Little Pollon"
,"Andrea, do you know a God called Chako?"
,"Never heard about him _ but today's here Samuele _ who's a real expert of myths and lores _ I can ask him"
,"I should ask Andrea about him _ he's the bookworm between us"
,"Anyway, the letter is too long to read it now"
,"Cosa sta succedendo?"
,"We're still working on it"
,"One more odd thing _ on the ISS they found a golden statuette similar to the statue I've seen"
,"Ok?"
,"Ah _ to know more about Chako we should find Samuele Navarro's 'Forgotten Lores about Known Saints' _ it should have a reference to another book with a lot of info"
,"Here you are _ whatever you may want to do with that"
,"Thanks"
,"I need a favor _ can you call this number when I ask you _ and keep this man busy as long as possible? _ He's a Military General _ but he seems shady"
,"Uh _ ok _ no problem _ I call him hiding my number _ and I'll try my charm _ call me right before you want me to call him"
,"Take it _ and try it"
,"Ok _ one second"
,"I prefer to keep it some more _ in case Enrica changes her mood"
,"I still need it"
,"Keep it"
,"What are you doing! _ stop NOW!"
,"Now we know what to ask the librarian"
,"Who are you, by the way?"
,"My name's a bit odd _ But you can call me Nic _ Today I'm your personal assistant"
,"You mean, photographer?"
,"Yes, that too"
,"Does KULT usually send photographers around?"
,"This is the first time ever _ as far as I know"
,"Why do you work for KULT?"
,"They don't pay contributors _ as far as I know"
,"Well, let's say I like their name"
,"Have you got a pass?"
,"Don't need one. I'm with you. _ YOU need one"
,"Are you sure?"
,"Si'"
,"What can I do to get my pass?"
,"One of those: show around you're a KULT journalist _ check if you've already received it _ or think about how to get it from the Postal Service"
,"Thanks _ they seem both odd and wise suggestions"
,"Do you know how to contact KULT?"
,"To check if they've received an envelope without any address? _ I'm sure they haven't _ and please remember that the pass was meant for you _ so if there's a Postal Magic Department I guess they'll also know that _ and they'll try to take it to you"
,"Come?"
,"BUT you need to help them a little"
,"Showing you're a KULT Underground journalist _ somehow"
,"Seriamente?"
,"Yup _ I'll do that _ if I was you _ or I could check if I already have received it _ or I could try to get it from Postal Service somehow _ but I'll prefer the first plan"
,"Thanks for the chat"
,"I like to talk"
,"Wow! nice badge _ and I love Game Festival!"
,"It would be cool if you have one similar _ with KULT Underground logo _ showing you're really a journalist"
,"It doesn't seem very solid"
,"Why are you showing me that?"
,"I think you're done _ this is what we were looking for"
,"Cool!"
,"Cool! You should try to put it in a badge"
,"Hi!"
,"Hello _ are you here just to look around AS USUAL? _ or do you need something printed?"
,"I'm looking for one of the first books by Samuele Navarro _ 'Forgotten Lores about Known Saints' _ have you got it?"
,"I've got ALL his books but ONE _ that you mention it's not quite famous and it's out of print _ but I've got only two copies left _ so one I could spare"
,"Thanks _ how much?"
,"Is this the first book that you buy ever?"
,"I think so, yes"
,"It's a gift then _ let's hope that you'll like it _ and you'll be back for more"
,"Don't count on it"
,"I mean _ yes _ I'm sure of it _ thanks"
,"Ehm... can you print me a logo taken from the web?"
,"I need the 'KULT Underground' website logo printed _ to fit this badge _ are you able to do that?"
,"I must start to make you pay for this kind of thing _ but considering that there's none here I'll do that _ please wait and consider buying a book for once!"
,"thanks!"
,"thank you so much!"
,"any chance you want a book?"
,"Sure! _ not now _ but I'll sure buy a book first or late"
,"Suits yourself"
,"Not here for books"
,"AS USUAL"
,"Do you know what happens if someone sent me something without writing my address?"
,"Well, you won't receive it"
,"But I mean _ if someone sent that even without my name on the envelope"
,"Well, you won't receive it _ two times"
,"Is there any way that I still get that?"
,"A miracle? _ Some magic? _ I surely won't bet money on that anyway"
,"Are you aware of how stupid you seem?"
,"A little, yes"
,"Good"
,"Ehm... just looking around"
,"Suits yourself _ not a busy day anyway _ damn online bookstores!"
,"He's one of the library's most active contributors for technical activities"
,"Uh he's wearing a polo with a 'Warhammer 40.000' label"
,"He's one of my heroes _ a great local writer _ who supports aspiring writers"
,"Nice to have a copy in my hand again!"
,"Now you know what to ask the librarian if you want to read that part"
,"Hi _ moving and interacting is simple _ you just need to use left-click and right-click _ and you'll be able to LOOK AT or to INTERACT _ you can also change that settings from the options _ if you prefer using left-click to INTERACT and right-click to LOOK AT"
,"Move the mouse around and check the drawer _ it's just behind me"
,"The door's locked _ you need a key to open it"
,"It's just a drawer"
,"Interacting with it can mean different things _ opening it _ checking it _ or moving it _ you don't have to worry about that _ you'll ask for interaction and you'll get it automatically if it's available _ in this case let's say that we open it and we find the door key"
,"Taken"
,"Now you see if on the inventory on the bottom right"
,"From there you can look at it _ or use it _ even DRAGGING it on other objects _ if the object allows interaction"
,"In this case, to end the tutorial you need to open the door"
,"We have nothing left to do with the drawer"
,"It's just a window"
,"INTERACT with it could open it _ in this case, it will just show this message _ but you got the point"
,"Ok. The door's now unlocked"
,"The door's already unlocked"
,"Prologue"
,"Two Weeks Ago"
,"Ten Days Ago"
,"Five Days Ago"
,"Two Days Ago"
,"Now"
,"Epilogue"
,"Welcome! At last, we meet"
,"Ehm..."
,"Come on!"
,"I actually expected you to arrive earlier _ but I'll pass this time."
,"We'll do that easier if you just shut up, ok? _ Your task is simple _ We need a mold of the chest key _ done with a special material"
,"Is this clear enough?"
,"I don't understand anything about your request _ and I don't understand why you are asking me to do that, too"
,"Civilians! _ It's Impossible to work with them _ I say it all the time _ but anyway I'll repeat it SLOWER _ GET MOLD OF CHEST KEY _ DO THAT WITH SPECIAL MATERIAL _ is that better?"
,"Even if I've understood your request _ why would I do that?"
,"Because I ORDER so _ that's simple as that _ NOW go _ and be quick"
,"Ah, take this"
,"there's my private number _ never call me ever _ but it's a matter of life or death _ mine, I mean"
,"Have you already got the mold?"
,"Nope"
,"So why are you wasting my time? _ GO GO GO!"
,"Actually, I have some questions..."
,"What material do you need for the mold?"
,"Amber-like"
,"What does it mean?"
,"AMBER-LIKE _ If it's good we'll be able to make a golden key from it!"
,"Why does everybody want amber?"
,"Cosa vuoi dire?"
,"Nothing"
,"How will you make a golden key from amber?"
,"It's a SECRET!"
,"AND DON'T LOOK THERE!"
,"Do you mean don't look at the covered object just over there?"
,"THAT'S RIGHT| _ It's a SECRET!"
,"There's something important just right here, correct?"
,"A S-E-C-R-E-T!"
,"Ok _ I didn't see anything"
,"Good _ I'm always impressed by how great I am in deceiving civilians"
,"What do you need a golden key for?"
,"AND DON'T LOOK THERE! GOLD!"
,"Gold?"
,"I didn't say philosopher's Stone, did I?"
,"Harry Potter's movie?"
,"Good _ I'm always impressed by how good civilians are at being fooled"
,"Why me?"
,"Because you are what I've found"
,"That doesn't mean anything"
,"But this is true"
,"I'll be back"
,"With RESULTS I hope!"
,"I don't think giving him what he wants _ it's the best thing to do"
,"I'm not really in the mood for sharing ODD things I've found _ with him _ above all when he may be interested in them"
,"Sara? _ can you do that thing _ now? _ thanks!"
,"I don't want to make a call right now"
,"It's big _ it seems like a box"
,"DON'T LOOK AT IT!"
,"DON'T TOUCH IT!"
,"DON'T LOOK AT IT! _ IT'S MY PRECIOUS!"
,"There are written 'Subject H' _ and 'Top Secret'"
,"I can't risk taking it _ but I can take a peek"
,"Uh _ there's Ermes picture! _ and it calls him 'Hermes'"
,"It's a golden ring _ it seems ancient _ or at least very old-fashioned in style"
,"I can't risk taking it"
,"Wow! _ there's a Gear Chest replica!"
,"Better put the cloth on before the General notice"
,"Let's see what happens"
,"Wow! _ he changed the amber key into a golden one!"
,"I don't think that trying it with the amber is smart _ if it becomes gold when it's still a rock then I could not create a key with that"
,"Better keep looking around _ till he's on the phone"
,"Hi Andrea"
,"Hi! _ What are you doing here?"
,"I'll explain later _ but first, you have to tell me about the drawings you made _ for the text you sent to Sara"
,"I'll explain later _ but it's important _ what are they? _ they're very similar to the ones on the Gear Chest _ in a part that you cannot have seen on the advertisement panels"
,"Uh"
,"What!"
,"I've seen them on the base of an old statue _ in the private park of a mansion just outside Modena _ I give private lessons to a rich kid _ he told me an odd thing about these writings appearing in front of his eyes _ the story was good _ I merge this part with my own"
,"an old statue?"
,"Well, it was the statue of a Greek Goddess _ but it can't be too old _ I mean _ it's not a museum _ it's a private mansion"
,"Today there are two events _ not considering the writing course _ first Samuele Navarro's latest book presentation _ and then _ the author _ and astronomer _ Lucia Tarrisi _ will talk about kids and science _ and she'll have a live video call with the ISS Italian astronaut Samantha Foretti _ wow!"
,"Today there are two events _ Navarro's book presentation _ and a public meeting with Tarrisi talking live to Foretti _ now on ISS"
,"The Activity Room today houses a Science lab _ to showcase custom 3D printers able to use special polymers _ quite interesting!"
,"This is the room where authors talk about their books _ they must pay me to enter"
,"It's a panel showcasing today's author's events _ boring"
,"Today there's a Science Lab about 3D prints and other odd things _ uh _ I'm met the organizer at Play Game Festival _ he's cool _ for a Boomer"
,"Can you tell me again about the drawings?"
,"I've seen them on the base of an old statue _ in the private park of a mansion just outside Modena _ a kid said they appeared in front of his eyes"
,"Do you know about a God called Chako?"
,"No _ but I can ask a real expert about him _ Samuele Navarro _ he's just over there"
,"I've found your book!"
,"Very well _ with its reference you should be able to find the other book _ and know more about this Chako god"
,"I've been able to fix the crack and close the chest"
,"But now to stop Chako for good we have to find a way to act on the golden statuette on the ISS"
,"I'll try something"
,"Thanks, for now"
,"Ok"
,"...if there are not any other questions _ I think we can close this writing lesson now _ because within minutes I'll do the book presentation of my latest novel _ thanks to all of you for attending my course _ and I hope you'll stay also for this event"
,"You're welcome _ and yes, of course, I'll stay"
,"Your support is always appreciated, Andrea _ and I've read your latest chapter _ you're really improving _ I loved it"
,"Thanks!"
,"I'm serious _ keep on working this hard _ and you'll have your first novel published within the year"
,"Ah, please at the end ask something _ ok? _ you know _ people are always shy at a book presentation"
,"Hi, Lucia, have you go ten minutes to spare?"
,"Hi, Samuele, yes _ what is it about?"
,"Well... this is my friend Andrea _ he and his friends have got a really odd story to tell _ and they need your help to close it"
,"Let's see _ but you've already got me with 'a real odd story' _ so, hi, Andrea, what do you need"
,"Wow! _ it's the most outrageous storyline I've heard in a long while"
,"But I..."
,"so I'm in! _ I know Samantha for so long _ that she won't even question my mental sanity _ before deciding if she's willing to cooperate or not"
,"Dice sul serio?"
,"Sure!"
,"Our event is at 19 _ but we agreed to hear each other half an hour before _ when I'll do that I'll ask _ how will you know if this thing works?"
,"We'll go where this whole thing started _ I'll call you from there"
,"Let's keep our fingers crossed then _ and don't you dare not tell me more _ about this thing later on _ ok?"
,"Thanks again _ I'll do that"
,"And thanks to you too"
,"Hi, Samuele, how are you?"
,"Hi, I'm fine _ even if today my public was just this single guy"
,"Nemo Profeta in Patria _ you should do your presentation where I live _ in Rome _ let's organize that"
,"Thanks _ we'll see _ but... have you go ten minutes to spare now?"
,"It's still early so yes _ what is it about?"
,"Well... let's start with..."
,"You said you would stay for the presentation _ have you changed your mind?"
,"No no don't worry _ I'll just go outside in the cloister _ till someone arrives _ I'll check the room all the time _ and I'll be back to join the others"
,"Please be patient _ we'll start the book presentation _ as soon as there'll be at least a couple of people"
,"I'm cool"
,"Was my last work really good?"
,"Yes _ I won't say that if I don't mean it _ you just started from my suggestions and wrote an impressive chapter"
,"Descriptions, mood, I really love it _ and it feels REAL"
,"I've blended reality and fiction _ as you said _ 90% fiction but 10% reality"
,"That's the key _ you can be good with imagination _ but when you add a piece of truth _ the reader feels the whole story is more real"
,"The scene in the Villa's park _ with the raven and the statue _ well that was vivid _ and a nice cliffhanger _ I want to read your next chapter as soon as it's ready"
,"Have you got some quick suggestions for me?"
,"You are already good _ you just need to practice and practice _ and take some risks _ exit from your comfort zone"
,"What about that?"
,"You are not asking for opinions from friends, are you? _ I suggest you try that too _ not because they can help _ someone yes, a lot of them, not _ but because this way you'll face public judgment"
,"Ok, I'll try that _ thanks"
,"I've seen today there's also Tarrisi here!"
,"Ah, yes _ she's really great _ as an author and as a person _ we've become somehow friends _ during her event she'll talk to another great person _ astronaut Foretti"
,"A curious thing _ Tarrisi told me that Foretti's colleagues on the ISS _ made a terrific joke to her _ they've been able to put an object outside the ISS _ and sent her to retrieve it _ when she reached it she discovered that it was a golden statue"
,"A Golden statue?"
,"Yes a small Golden statue of a Greek Goddess"
,"Wow! _ this can mean..."
,"Before you think about the odd theory _ I'll add that there was 'made in China' on the bottom of the object"
,"Yes _ they denied the joke _ but that details ruined the 'Star Trek' episode effect"
,"Ehm... you said a Greek Goddess statue _ which Goddess?"
,"Yes _ I imagine your surprise _ but coincidences are just coincidences _ anyway it was indeed the same one you choose in your last chapter _ Artemis"
,"How many people are you expecting?"
,"Well, it's always impossible to say _ and this is the fourth presentation in town for this book _ but I keep my finger crossed"
,"I do _ but how can you know about him? _ he's a classic 'Forgotten God' _ a myth element that's been deliberately removed from a point forward"
,"We still have not connected all the dots _ but maybe he could be somehow related to the Museums Palace's Gear Chest _ and the Artemis statue too _ What can you tell me about him?"
,"I don't remember any more than his name _ I've written about him in two short lines in my old book _ 'Forgotten Lores about Known Saints' _ but in that book, I've written a bibliographic note _ about a specific book with a whole chapter about him"
,"Can you tell me that book title?"
,"I'm sorry _ but I don't remember its exact name _ and I don't have any copy of my book left _ it's not even present in this public library _ not a real great success that book _ I'm sorry"
,"Thanks _ you've been helpful _ we'll move from here"
,"We need your help"
,"We? About what?"
,"Do you remember I've asked you about Chako _ telling you that he may have been connected to the new-found Gear Chest? _ the whole story is big _ and we need a way to contact the ISS"
,"Ok _ tell me everything _ then I'll see what to do _ if I'm not wrong Lucia should be here any minute now"
,"I let you prepare"
,"Hello dear _ how can I help you?"
,"Hi _ I've found the book I was looking for in a used book library"
,"Good for you! _ Enjoy your reading!"
,"My what?"
,"Hi _ I'm looking for a Navarro book named 'Forgotten Lores about Known Saints'"
,"I know the author quite well _ but I'm sorry _ this is one of his first books and we don't have any copies here"
,"Is there any other thing that I can do for you?"
,"Hi _ I'm looking for a really ancient book _ from the 1945 _ called 'Forgotten Gods' by KULT Virtual Press"
,"I know the publishing house _ but not the title _ I'll check on the computer _ ah _ yes _ we have a copy _ one second"
,"Have you got the library card, haven't you? I need it to lend you this book"
,"Uh? _ no I haven't any cards for books _ but I don't want to take this book home"
,"A... B... C.. _ Chako! _ here we are _ but _ uh _ it's missing the whole chapter! _ someone stripped it away!"
,"What? Let me see"
,"oh _ you're right _ serious damage that must be punished! _ let's check who's taken it last time _ Don Camillo? _ the Rector of the Seminary? _ quite odd _ but he's the last one that asked for this book _ in 1968"
,"The Rector of the Seminary? _ it's good to know _ thanks"
,"Ah _ can you take this? _ I don't need it anymore"
,"Not the exact procedure for donation _ but why not?"
,"I'm just looking around _ to see if there's something interesting"
,"Well, we're in a Public Library _ there are tons of interesting things"
,"Funny _ my own thought"
,"Uh, I think that without a precise title _ I won't find anything even walking around _ better ask the librarian _ once I know what I'm interested in"
,"It's a normal computer _ connected to the library database"
,"If you need to search for something _ just ask"
,"Hi! If you are here to see our 3d printer in action _ we're sorry to say that we've finished all the polymer materials one hour ago _ but I'm here to answer your questions if you've got any"
,"Hello!"
,"Hi! feel free to give a look around _ and ask if you need extra info about something"
,"Ah... this is our special glue to work with metals AND woods _ it's able to blend organic material perfectly _ able to glue anything _ you can also mix glue with crumbs of the item material to fix small imperfections"
,"the tube is almost empty _ so I could share _ but what do you need it for?"
,"A box?"
,"You can use less special glue for that"
,"My mum's jewels?"
,"My dog's pacemaker?"
,"A Warhammer thing?"
,"Ah! are you a fan too? _ I've got three hundred miniatures!"
,"Hundreds? I got thousands of what you said!"
,"Wow! _ Ok, take it _ you'll love it, it's like magic!"
,"Maybe I don't need it after all"
,"These are our unique colors _ their special formula is perfect if you want to paint even organic things _ you won't believe how good it is"
,"No, you cannot take them away _ but you can use a bit of them here if you want to try them on something _ be aware _ that colors won't wash away _ ever"
,"let's try to get a blue feather from a black one"
,"Wow _ it seems REAL"
,"Yes _ it's unbelievable"
,"It's a custom model of a 3D printer _ they always fascinated me _ a little"
,"I'm sorry _ but we've finished the printing material"
,"I'm sorry but it doesn't work with any material _ it uses just a specific set of plastic polymers"
,"Maybe it's better if I check if Sara's free _ before crashing in"
,"Hi, Sara _ I'm ready for your help with my article _ do you have time now?"
,"Sorry _ I still need a few minutes to finish handling things with Enrica _ can you come a little later?"
,"Sure _ come up"
,"Ok _ let's go to see what this General wants from me"
,"Why should I go to the Military Academy?"
,"I don't need to go to the Library now"
,"I don't need to go there now"
,"Hello young guy _ come near"
,"I guess you're the one that found a chapter is missing, correct?"
,"How can..."
,"A call from the librarian _ minutes ago _ yes _ I took away those pages _ they're in our library now _ not for your eyes _ that story _ started around 400 a.C. also with the help of our Patron"
,"I say that because we've heard about the Museums Palace discovery _ and it's clear that you've done research and legwork _ but I won't say much more _ if you don't show me that you already know enough"
,"We may need some help too"
,"Unprobable _ but I'll help if you'll convince me there's a reason for help"
,"Hello, we need information _ and may help too"
,"I'll give you information only if I think it's needed _ and I'll help only if I think it's needed _ convince me about that"
,"I've been contacted by a General _ he made me produce this Golden Key _ to open the Gear Chest"
,"Ok _ interesting _ and worrying _ but so far I'm not willing to help _ is there more?"
,"I've met an odd girl _ sent here by I can't guess who _ who's carrying this wand _ able to change the solidity of amber-like materials _ we think that it can be used to remove the isolating part inside the chest"
,"We've been able to find a way to use the gears of the chest to make the key usable"
,"Wow _ you're good _ a bit too much _ what do you want to do with that?"
,"Anyway _ opening the chest is impossible _ you need to solve the gears puzzle just to use its key _ that's been broken centuries ago and must be golden _ then you have to remove the solid amber-section to reach the inside wooden box"
,"But even if you do that _ that box won't open or be breakable _ until you deactivate two mystical seals _ set one in a real statue _ and the other one set in a statuette turned gold _ and thrown into space!"
,"what do you mean thrown into space?"
,"Chest is solid _ but there are human factions at play _ convinced that the Chest can give them power or richness _ and they've been able to break the seals several times in more than a millennia _ last time they broke one _ it was the 60s _ we asked NASA a favor _ and they free the statuette during Moon mission _ so it's impossible for anyone to deactivate it again"
,"Ehm"
,"Ehm what?"
,"Both seals have been deactivated _ and the Gear Chest has got a crask in its inner box"
,"We're doomed"
,"Do you know that the box inside the chest has got a crack?"
,"This change everything _ no _ we didn't know _ so now we don't have to avoid that the chest is opened _ but we have to open it _ to fix the crack _ and then we have to close it again _ for good"
,"Who's 'we'"
,"You _ 'we' is you _ but we'll help _ take this key _ it's the original Saint Geminiano's key _ the one used to lock the Chest when it was built _ it can be used just to close the chest _ not for opening it"
,"Can you repeat what we have to do to prevent _ the apocalypse?"
,"Well, not the real apocalypse _ but that's not the point I suppose"
,"To avoid that you need to open the Gear Chest _ fix the crack _ and close the Chest again"
,"We..."
,"No _ we'll play it in a different way _ tell me what you know or what you have first _ then I'll decide what to share"
,"You don't seem worried about what's going on"
,"No _ because I'm sure that opening the chest is impossible"
,"We found a wand able to liquefy the amber!"
,"We created an amber key!"
,"We created a golden key!"
,"We found a potential scheme for the Chest!"
,"What do you want more?"
,"I don't want anything more _ because opening the chest is impossible"
,"you need to solve the gears puzzle just to use its key _ that's been broken centuries ago and must be golden _ then you have to remove the solid amber section to reach the inside wooden box"
,"That you were able to do _ first in sixteen centuries"
,"But even now _ even if you extract the wooden box you won't be able to open or break it before someone will stop you"
,"because to open it, God forbids that, considering what's inside _ you must first deactivate two mystical seals _ set one in a real statue _ and the other set in a statuette turned gold _ and thrown into space!"
,"Chest is solid _ but there are human factions at play _ convinced that the Chest can give them power or richness _ and they've been able to break the seals several times in more than a millennia"
,"last time they broke one _ it was the 60s _ we asked NASA a favor _ we made a seal from a souvernir similar to a real statue _ turned it into gold and give them _ and they free the statuette in the space during the Lunar mission _ so it's impossible for anyone to deactivate it again"
,"Both seals have been deactivated _ and the Gear Chest has got a crack in its inner box"
,"It's impossible _ how?"
,"Someone broke the statue _ the statuette hit the ISS _ and an astronaut must have been touched it in the wrong way"
,"We're doomed _ if opened we'll see the closest thing to the apocalypse _ that can happen"
,"Does that mean you'll help us somehow? _ at least telling us what to do"
,"You need to open the Gear Chest _ fix the crack _ and close the Chest again _ that would be the best start _ but then we'll need to find a way to reactivate the seals _ including the one in space"
,"How can they be reactivated?"
,"If seals are broken _ it means that the statuette has been opened and its content extracted _ it must be put inside again _ and closed in a specific way I can tell you _ that will align the real statue too"
,"It seems easy"
,"If it wasn't on Earth's orbit"
,"We'll see what we can do"
,"take this _ this is the Golden Key needed to close the Chest once you've opened it _ this won't break itself after you use it _ I want it back"
,"So, if you can't tell me that I'm wrong about that..."
,"Ehm, one seal has been surely deactivated _ the statue nearby"
,"Are you sure about that?"
,"Yes _ a friend of mine saw it"
,"It's bad _ but the other one is impossible to reach _ so we're still relatively safe"
,"That's all"
,"Take it for now"
,"Sorry, you can't go there."
,"Hi _ do you want to make an offer for a charity event"
,"Sure _ but not this year"
,"Do you think this can be good for the charity event?"
,"Are you sure you want to give us it? _ I'm not an expert but it seems an expensive object?"
,"Oh _ if it's for the a good cause I don't care _ take it"
,"Thanks then!"
,"I don't want to give the mirror away _ before having at least tried to use it with the Goth girl"
,"Welcome! _ but if you are one of the volunteer boys _ to prepare the items to sell during the charity event _ you are really late _ your friends left three hours ago"
,"Ehm _ nope _ I'm here to talk with the Rector _ if it's possible"
,"Can I know the reason?"
,"It's for a missing chapter in a book he took in the Public Library fifty years ago"
,"I guess it's considered a crime against the humanity _ if they send someone after half a century _ anyway he's office is on your right _ please go _ ah _ he was already a priest I think _ but he was not a Rector then"
,"Sorry, the library is not open to the public _ but if you need a specific book you can ask our Rector _ and he usually lets students read volumes here"
,"They seems wood processing waste _ small pieces of shavings _ and yes _ even one olive branch"
,"It's the last olive branch _ all the other ones have been used, together with other materials _ to create the items for the charity event"
,"Consider that's really from Jerusalem _ one of our Priests took some of them back from a Religious trip"
,"Can I take it?"
,"Ok I guess"
,"We may want to use it _ to do some other objects _ we'd like to have some more items to sell during the charity event"
,"Don't you have something that you can spare _ to help us? _ A small object you don't need it anymore _ but that's fancy enough to be sold"
,"I'll think about that"
,"A bunch of small hand carved figures _ not to bad"
,"I'm sorry, but these are for the charity event"
,"Metropolitan Seminary, Modena, Italy"
,"I think General will find it hard to explain"
,"how he lost this four hundred pounds gear chest replica _ that was inside his office _ but this is the only way they can't try anything soon"
,"I'm sure he'll find the perfect words for that"
,"Your irony shows an understandable resentment I guess"
,"I've been locked out for a long time _ out just for some specific task"
,"I see"
,"What about now? What about me?"
,"I'll get rid of the ring as soon as you leave this room _ behave _ and we won't care about you _ as we've done for almost two thousand year"
,"We may see each other again _ for the Gear Chest _ if the fix for the crack won't hold _ but you know that too"
,"Am I free to leave?"
,"You can go"
,"But you can't do it that way!"
,"what's that?"
,"ah! _ the Chet Barker album I lost when I was a teen!"
,"You can't do that too!"
,"but thanks"
,"No, it is not a local newspaper"
,"Ehm _ nope _ it is not a National one either"
,"It's an online magazine _ I don't think you've heard of it _ it's named 'KULT Underground'"
,"it's more a fanzine _ but hey it's the first and only one that gave me a chance for an article"
,"and they also send me a photographer! _ I'm waiting for him right now"
,"And how is this cousin of yours that you've never met?"
,"Uh, I need to go _ I guess my photographer is here _ see you later? _ I could  come to your house to write the article _ and tonight _ when Andrea's done with his writing class _ we all could have a beer somewhere"
,"Bye, Sara"
,"Are you Marco, yes?"
,"Yes, I am _ and I guess you're KULT Underground's photographer"
,"In a way, yes _ what gave me away?"
,"I haven't seen someone carrying a camera for a while"
,"Ah, yes _ I'm an old dude _ really older than I look _ are you ready to go? _ the public meeting was set for 5 p.m. if I'm not wrong"
,"Yes, we've still got time _ Museums Palace is nearby"
,"in that direction"
,"but I think it's better to arrive early _ there'll be a lot of press for such an event"
,"I won't count on that _ but who knows _ let's go then _ I'll follow you"
,"Uh... I've got an idea"
,"Uh... the bookseller usually receives and sends a lot of envelopes _ I could ask him if he knows how Postal Service handles these issues"
,"Uh... I could get home and see if there's something useful to fix this missing pass issue"
,"Uh _ odd _ this specific spot is dirtier"
,"I won't touch it _ nor clean it"
,"Let's see if there's really a crow _ that loves Red Bike's food"
,"Wow! _ even if he's not blue _ let's try to take a feather"
,"I could not get him _ but at least he left what I wanted"
,"'Beers, Wines and food'"
,"'Used books and printing service'"
,"It's a black crow feather"
,"Uh _ that smells!"
,"free city maps"
,"Can I take one of these?"
,"Don't you live next door _ since FOREVER? _ Anyway yes no problem"
,"I don't need another one"
,"Wow! A lot of books _ boring"
,"Nah... I don't want to get addicted"
,"You're late _ a group of people arrived _ and they ate all the things I've prepared for the buffet _ there are few things left _ till I've ready some more food to offer"
,"if you're here for the aperitif buffet _ I'm sorry but it's not ready yet"
,"By the way _ please don't eat outside _ in these last few days there are crows _ and they're aggressive _ if they think they can get something to eat"
,"Crows?"
,"Yes. It's been a couple of weeks top _ but they're annoying"
,"Hey! you can't go there! _ I'll take out the food as soon as it's ready _ be patient"
,"Hi! What can I get you?"
,"Uhm... I'll think about it"
,"Ok, I'm not in a hurry"
,"There's a single tartlet left _ with salmon"
,"I feel always guilty in taking the last one _ but not this time"
,"As usual, I'm late!"
,"I won't take the whole buffet plate"
,"What do you think of the Gear Chest?"
,"That the crack is a problem"
,"You missed a very odd thing!"
,"What? And where?"
,"A gothic girl pushed me away with just the power of her will!"
,"Mmh... if you're not talking about some wrong approach _ to a cute girl _ it reminds me of something _ that usually depends on a necklace"
,"I mean this girl could have had a necklace _ with a micro fragment of Medusa's eyes"
,"Ehm... who's REALLY Ermes? or Hermes"
,"Well _ for a start he VANISHES _ but that was almost ok _ then I've seen a dossier on him on a General office"
,"You won't believe me if I tell you"
,"Try me"
,"Let's say he's a messenger _ and a trickster _ he is... we are... special _ and old _ we helped to create the Gear Chest _ and we made a pact about that"
,"I don't believe you!"
,"See? _ But... did you also see a ring? A golden one? _ that could explain a lot"
,"A lot of what?"
,"There are ways to constrain us _ and to free us _ but not important for now _ anyway if this General knows Hermes _ probably wants the Gear Chest"
,"He does"
,"That Gear Chest MUST stay closed _ or at least that was the way _ BEFORE knowing that there's a crack inside _ now I don't know what to do"
,"I don't believe you, you know?"
,"Maybe I believe you a bit"
,"Ehm... who's Ermes?"
,"And don't tell me you don't know him"
,"It's an old friend _ more than that _ a brother _ but we lost contact _ I didn't even know he was still around"
,"He's not that old!"
,"More than you can imagine _ but so am I"
,"Do you have a picture of the lateral inscriptions?"
,"Let me check _ yes _ this one shows them in a good way _ do you want it too?"
,"Send it to Sara _ she wants to try something _ to see if it's possible to crack the gears section"
,"Let's hope so _ done"
,"What are you drinking?"
,"A Belgian beer _ this place offers some unexpected treats _ do you want one too?"
,"Nope _ thanks _ I drink just Spritz and Corona _ not together"
,"Anyway _ the bartender gave me a 'Free Drinks' card for tonight _ because of a couple of cocktail special recipes I knew and he didn't _ but it doesn't cover what I want to drink so for me it's useless _ take it"
,"Do you know a God called Chako?"
,"How did you find out about Chaotiki-Kako? _ It's a powerful God _ devoted to Chaos _ he's the one that we locked in the Gear Chest _ with the help of Saint Geminian and some other skilled members of his team _ we tried to erase his memory _ but he was able to influence people even caged that way"
,"That simple crack probably lets him act in a very real way all around"
,"There's a way to defeat him?"
,"Yes _ keeping him in the cage in which he should be locked in"
,"Hello there _ thanks for the drinks _ next time you need a Museums Palace press pass _ just give me a call _ and I'll see if I'll still remember you"
,"International Space Station, Earth orbit"
,"Samantha, how bad does the damage look?"
,"The fragment appears to have stained the hull"
,"But it does not seem to have caused any more damage than we expected"
,"Roger"
,"But I'm here now... _ let's see..."
,"Wow!"
,"What's up?"
,"I REALLY can't understand how you guys were able to do that _ but this is the best trick I've seen in all my life"
,"Sorry, what do you mean?"
,"Best trick ever"
,"Welcome! Here you are! _ come _ don't be shy _ we're proud of our discovery _ and happy that all you important people of the press _ are willing to hear about it from us"
,"It's not exactly protocol _ but it's fine if this time you mister _ took your little kid with you today"
,"Ehm _ actually I'm the journalist here"
,"I'm just the photographer"
,"Uh _ sorry _ for what important magazine are you working little kid?"
,"Ehm _ KULT Underground"
,"Did you know that one?"
,"Sure _ who doesn't?"
,"Well well _ anyway _ let's take it short _ then you'll be able to see the Gear Chest _ The Gear Chest is the MOST incredible discovery ever made _ an almost two thousand years old chest with peculiar characteristics _ discovered by our young but skilled team"
,"Ok, let's sign it _ uh _ I'm the first one"
,"I've already signed this register"
,"It's a register for the visitors' name"
,"It's still empty"
,"There's just my name on it"
,"Ah, yes, don't forget to sign the presence register"
,"Yes do that _ It's important"
,"Hello again"
,"Uh _ see? _ you got the pass, after all, _ I'm really the best in everything I do!"
,"Ah _ by the way _ your colleague asked about you _ to end his shift I guess"
,"Ah _ yes _ he's right _ I'll go within minutes"
,"Hi, I hope you've enjoyed what you've seen!"
,"Welcome! _ I'm your guest _ feel free to ask me anything you like _ but please stay at least two meters from the Gear Chest _ it's a precious artifact and we don't want to risk ruining it"
,"Hi _ I'm here _ you can go now"
,"Thanks _ see you later, ok?"
,"As I said _ we'll prefer you don't come any closer _ sorry"
,"Well, it's an impressive object _ but I feel chilling standing right here _ got a really bad feeling"
,"DON'T touch it"
,"The gears that gave this Chest its name"
,"It seems a keyhole"
,"But it's blocked"
,"It's a carved human-like figure _ it really seems the IKEA instruction person icon"
,"Mmh... his little finger is really odd in shape"
,"Quite unusual inscriptions _ they could be based on an alphabet _ but I won't bet on that"
,"What's the Gear Chest?"
,"It's an impressive object _ it's a chest of different materials _ from marble to lead _ containing another chest _ probably wooden _ separated by an insulating layer"
,"We're not too sure because we've not opened it yet _ and this is the Gear part _ see the front? _ hundreds of interconnected gears _ locking a final mechanism to open with a key"
,"So, it looks like a safe, isn't it?"
,"A safe _ or a serious cage"
,"What's inside it?"
,"It seems a wooden chest _ using X-rays and ultrasounds we've seen something _ it may be a coffin _ or not _ too early to say"
,"But there's surely a crack _ in this inner chest"
,"How big is this crack?"
,"It's minimal _ but it's odd _ considering how protected is from the outside"
,"How will you open it?"
,"Not a clue _ and I'll write at least two essays and a book about that"
,"Can I touch it?"
,"On my dead body"
,"Will you be here all day?"
,"Hello no _ I hope _ Mr. Rossi should take my place later on"
,"When will you end your shift?"
,"Uh _ anytime now _ I hope _ Mr. Rossi should be here soon"
,"If you see him _ would you ask him about that? _ he's got my same lab coat _ and a coffee in his hand"
,"You're welcome _ I'm here for you"
,"Hello..."
,"Before asking me anything _ please consider that I'm a real expert _ so probably everything I'll say will be too complex for you _ to understand _ so questions are more or less a waste of time"
,"Don't need to thank me _ I'll do it for you"
,"What's that?"
,"It's a Free Drinks card for the Red Bike _ I've received it _ but I'm not in the mood for drinking _ so I was wondering if you were interested"
,"Ah! _ who doesn't! _ but I should stay here for another couple of hours tonight"
,"Oh _ it's a shame _ card is valid just for today _ and if you go there too late you won't find any free buffet food"
,"It's a really hard ethical situation _ one that philosophers study all their lives"
,"If you go _ I won't tell _ and it doesn't seem that there's a lot of other people coming _ am I wrong?"
,"You devil _ thanks _ and there's the guard at the entrance _ so it should not be a problem if I go"
,"It shows the inner schematic of the Gear Chest _ a box inside a box with a separation layer too"
,"They are really a lot of them _ without knowing a scheme _ even if they're working _ I couldn't imagine _ how many tries one should do _ to check all the available combinations"
,"No need to do anything more"
,"Let's try Sara's scheme"
,"uh! _ I heard a click"
,"it works!"
,"and now the keyhole is not blocked anymore!"
,"I've already used it"
,"I don't have any key to use with it"
,"And at the moment is blocked _ so even with a key _ not usable"
,"I can't use any key _ without doing something else before _ because the keyhole at the moment is blocked"
,"Let's try that too"
,"yes! _ now a lateral piece of the Chest is free!"
,"But _ as they said _ the key is broken now"
,"And I don't think that the darkness I see is a good sign"
,"Let's check if this second key closes the chest"
,"I guess we're done! _ the crack is filled _ and the chest is closed again! _ the last thing we need is to fix thes seal too _ and we can forget about this whole thing!"
,"But for that, we need to find a way to act on the statuette on the ISS"
,"I haven't any clue about how to do that _ but I hope my friends have"
,"It doesn't seem to work _ maybe I should put the amber back first"
,"It's better if I don't close the chest again _ before having closed also the crack _ the opening golden key is broken _ I can't easily get another one"
,"This key can only close the chest"
,"The keyhole is blocked _ there's no way I can take a mold of anything"
,"Uh _ thinking about it now _ how can I make a mold of a key _ from its keyhole? _ It's not possible"
,"Uh nope _ key enters but I cannot turn it _ it seems right but wrong at the same time"
,"I don't know what I should do with that"
,"The odd finger... it may be shaped like a silhouette of a key"
,"Let's try"
,"Yes! _ I don't know if this is what General wants _ but it looks like a key"
,"This piece of the chest is now opened _ and I can see the interior"
,"The crack isn't visible anymore"
,"The crack is quite visible now"
,"I can't do anything using just my bare hands"
,"Done!"
,"I can't try to fix the crack _ until I get rid of the amber layer"
,"Let's put some fragments of the olive branch _ and then let's try to glue it"
,"Now we 'just' have to close the Gear Chest _ and activate the seals again _ as soon as possible"
,"Uh _ the crack needs some filling _ I can't use just the glue to close it"
,"I guess I need to use a similar material _ some kind of wood"
,"I can't try to fix the crack _ without first opening a section of the chest"
,"Uh _ the crack needs some filling _ but I also need something to make it hold _ this way can't work"
,"These titles give a new meaning to the word 'BORING'"
,"It's a normal Postbox"
,"They're handy if you _ for some odd reason _ want to send a letter to someone _ who does that now?"
,"Mmh... I wonder if my pass has been sent thru this _ and if it's still inside"
,"I don't need to send anything to anyone"
,"There's written than Postal Service retrieves its content once a day _ before 12"
,"It's a small keyhole _ I guess it's used to open the Postbox and retrieve its content"
,"I can't do anything with bare hands"
,"I'm not sure it's legal"
,"And I don't think it's useful _ but I won't tell anybody"
,"Ok _ let's do that _ a journalist must do whatever it takes!"
,"There's a letter!"
,"But uhm that's not the one for KULT Underground!"
,"And I've broken my screwdriver"
,"Hardly a shame _ but you have to find another way to get your pass"
,"Here we are again _ have you got a pass?"
,"YES!"
,"I'm an invited guest!"
,"I really doubt that"
,"I'm a journalist, here to do an article about the discovery!"
,"Yes, sure _ show me your pass"
,"What pass?"
,"The pass that the staff have sent to every invited guest, once they've accepted to attend"
,"I didn't get one!"
,"That's a shame _ but then you can't enter"
,"What kind of pass should I have?"
,"The one we sent to our invited guests"
,"What does it look like?"
,"It's a pass I'll be able to recognize once you'll show it to me"
,"Wait _ you haven't seen one, have you?"
,"Well _ but that doesn't change anything"
,"So am I the first journalist so far?"
,"Maybe"
,"Why do I need a pass to attend?"
,"There are been curious episodes since the discovery _ Dr. Pellacani is afraid to someone may want _ to steal the Gear Chest"
,"How safer is using passes?"
,"It's a lot safer _ because now I'm here _ checking for them"
,"Who sent it to me?"
,"Someone in our staff _ I don't know all these boring details"
,"How can he know me?"
,"I mean, I didn't know about this event since three hours ago _ when I've received a mail from the website I'm in contact with"
,"No idea _ but I got your point _ you could try to ask Mr. Rossi about it"
,"It's over there"
,"Drinking its coffee, as usual"
,"Do you think he will be able to help?"
,"Maybe _ but anyway you'll annoy someone else for a while _ and that's anyway a progress _ for me"
,"You really won't let me in?"
,"Without a pass? Not a chance"
,"Why are you wearing sunglasses?"
,"Fa lo stesso"
,"Bye"
,"Are you really threatening me with a screwdriver? _ I don't need it _ but be aware that I've got a gun _ and a chainsaw to dispose of your corpse _ but this last part is not official so don't mention it around"
,"Sorry to bother _ but I'm here for the conference but the guy over there won't let me in"
,"And?"
,"Do you anything about press passes? _ I've been sent here three hours ago and I didn't get one"
,"Not my problem _ I sent passes to magazines, not to journalists _ it's their job to give them to you then _ Who do you work for?"
,"Ehm... KULT Underground"
,"Ah, cool, my father was used to sending them poems ten years ago _ I know them"
,"Good _ but being a web magazine _ did you send them a digital pass?"
,"Nope, I sent only plastic passes"
,"Where to?"
,"To them!"
,"Ehm... there's not a physical place related to that website _ so... where to?"
,"Listen _ I didn't find an address _ so I simple wrote 'KULT Underground' on the envelope _ then it's a Postal Service problem to find them _ they can do that sometimes"
,"Anyway, I am not the culprit"
,"Go away"
,"Go away _ don't you see I'm drinking a coffee? _ That's the international sign that I'm on a break"
,"Nah... I don't need a drink now _ and if I did I'll go to my usual place"
,"It's the panel of the presentation _ 'The Gear Chest _ the most important discovery ever _ we're serious' _ and they're modest too I guess"
,"Get lost! _ Don't you see I'm trying to cast a spell?"
,"Are you one of those fools _ that can't understand when they're out of their league?"
,"Oddly I have a problem casting a spell on that sunglassed guy _ that doesn't let me enter _ but I'm sure I won't have any with you"
,"GET LOST! NOW!"
,"WOW! _ that's the coolest thing EVER _ she just made me walk away _ simply ordering me to do that! _ I couldn't control my own legs"
,"WOW!"
,"I'm just sorry there was not Nic to see that _ nobody would believe me if I say such a thing"
,"Oh _ I feel suddenly very confused _ and in an urge to go away from here"
,"But what do I have to do? _ I don't understand"
,"Are you ok?"
,"Yes _ I'm ok _ I have an important task to do"
,"LEAVE ME ALONE!"
,"What are you doing?"
,"I'm trying to force the guard to let me enter _ I need to get to the Gear Chest _ I have to OPEN IT! _ WE WICCA WANT TO OPEN IT _ THERE'S IPAZIA'S HEAD INSIDE _ AND ALL HER SECRET SPELLS!"
,"Ipazia? _ Are you sure about that?"
,"Can you go back to Sara..."
,"...and help us understand what's going on?"
,"I don't... but... ok I'll do that _ I can't resist"
,"Museums Palace, Modena, Italy"
,"the intern had just started working on the sarcophagus"
,"when he received a phone call and simply left _ just like that _ and he never came back"
,"this generation Z _ no work ethic _ is completely different from us Millenials"
,"so true"
,"uh _ it's already 5 p.m."
,"Are you coming for a drink with us?"
,"sure, but I..."
,"thump!"
,"But was this door always there?"
,"Well... let's put it this way _ how could it not?"
,"THUMP!"
,"The noise seems to come from there"
,"Maybe we should talk about that to Professor Pellacani"
,"I guess you're right _ tomorrow?"
,"Tomorrow!"
,"I think this Gear Chest thing is a wonderful opportunity _ for our careers"
,"Me too"
,"Even if..."
,"...it means also a lot of work"
,"I'm happy about that of course _ but"
,"Oh..."
,"Do you think we should warn Professor Pellacani _ about this unexpected reality change?"
,"I think he's on the phone with National TV _ asking for coverage"
,"So you think we should tell him _ now _ or tomorrow?"
,"It's 5 p.m. o'clock now _ tomorrow should be good too"
,"Villa Mariotti, near Turin, Italy"
,"Anne! Anne!"
,"Are you sick again, General? You're really pale"
,"No, yes..."
,"I mean, I don't feel well, but this time I'm happy about that"
,"Sir?"
,"Call Michele, quick _ tell him to alert the special team _ the Gear Chest reappeared _ and we have now the chance to open it _ and get the Stone"
,"I'm feeling the crack widening minute by minute _ inside my head _ louder than ever _ go now!"
,"Yes, Sir _ A great news, Sir"
,"Villa Martini, near Modena, Italy"
,"Hey! Give me back my pen!"
,"Here you are, stupid beast!"
,"Ops..."
,"Hey..."
,"What does she say?"
,"One minute _ she's written that she's trying to work _ on the golden statue _ right now"
,"What do you think?"
,"Give her time"
,"Something is changing!"
,"Done! _ This seal is active again!"
,"What about now? _ What's going to happen?"
,"Without the crack _ and with this seal on _ it should have little power left to interact with us _ now we just have to wait _ and let's see if everything will be fine _ at least for a while"
,"There's a lot of stuff I've received and never care to check _ usually they're bills _ that I pay automatically from my bank account"
,"Uh... yes... they're mostly bills"
,"But there's also a letter _ from my only uncle with my same name _ the family MAD uncle _ who's not got at least one?"
,"It's my TV cabinet drawer"
,"Let's see if there's something useful inside _ uh _ a never-used small screwdriver"
,"Apart from a few useless instruction manuals _ wasted paper _ there is nothing of interest"
,"It's my TV set _ that I usually don't use _ I don't even know if it's still working"
,"Yup, it's not working anymore _ not that I really care _ I watch everything online now using my tablet"
,"It's my stuff badge from Play _ the Game Festival _ I've helped Andrea with a stand _ boring as hell _ but for cosplayers"
,"Let's take it"
,"It's my old tablet _ I use it for all the important tasks _ Social Media and Netflix _ ah, yes _ sometimes I use it also for the writing of course"
,"Uh _ the battery's dead"
,"I guess I should find another way to write my article"
,"I don't need it now"
,"So, I hope your room is ok..."
,"Have you got a key for that?"
,"For the room? _ No, sorry I usually don't have guests _ this is my studio _ my mom brought me a bed and that's all"
,"Can't say I'm happy about that"
,"Sorry? _ I didn't know you _ mum said you're a distant cousin and you need a place to crash for a couple of weeks _ I trust you enough to live with me in the place in which I've got ALL my stuff _ and you don't trust me enough to have your room unlocked?"
,"Yes _ we all know why I'm here _ don't pretend _ you all want to control me _ and yes _ my possessions are far more important than your whole house"
,"How exactly are we related?"
,"Ask your mum _ if you don't have other urgent things to say _ I'm going to cast spell protection on that room _ and leave _ I've got an important thing to do"
,"Do you do drugs?"
,"Ha ha _ really funny"
,"My mum should explain to me a lot of things _ the first time we'll meet again"
,"What's THAT? _ What she put on my door handle!"
,"I don't want to leave now"
,"Ordering pictures online is not something I'll do again soon"
,"I'm tempted to take it down _ but I won't do it now"
,"DON'T YOU DARE!"
,"Hey! The door's blocked! _ This amber thing won't let me open it"
,"What is this thing? _ It seems an amber rock _ with the door handle INSIDE"
,"It's the door to Erica's room"
,"I don't think it's polite to enter Sara's room"
,"An almost bald man low-res picture _ Sara's got odd tastes sometimes"
,"The door's blocked!"
,"It's an amber-like rock _ solid _ covering the door handle"
,"I cannot break it or remove it with bare hands _ it's a rock!"
,"I'm here to help you understand what's going on"
,"Let's start with the door handle..."
,"You could start removing that thing _ on the door lock!"
,"Yes _ it would help you understand _ considering what I've left inside the room _ tiko!"
,"Why are you here in Modena?"
,"I've been sent here to open the Gear Chest _ and restore Ipazia's head and her spell secrets _ I won't say more about that"
,"Ipazia, like the Greek Philosopher?"
,"That one, killed as a witch"
,"How did you plan to open the Gear Chest?"
,"Using the wand _ once re-activated _ the wand will liquefy the amber and open the chest"
,"Are you sure to know how the Gear Chest is made?"
,"My sisters know everything there's to know"
,"Ok, for now"
,"It's an amber rock"
,"I don't want to touch it"
,"Mmh... it could be useful"
,"How does it work? _ one second ago was on the door handle _ then it became fluid like _ and now it's solid again"
,"This is a piece of amber liquified by the Wand _ when it was intact and working _ some of my sisters were able _ to make it respond to some vocal commands _ now it answers to 'tiko' and to 'skliros' _ but it's old and our powers weak _ it's more a trick than something really useful"
,"Argh... I forgot to take my laptop from my studio _ it's still in now-Enrica's room _ but I need it for my project!"
,"I'M LEAVING! _ I'LL BE BACK WHEN I'LL BE BACK!"
,"Gosh _ it will be a very long week _ but at least I'll be able to retrieve my computer"
,"Ah! _ I've looked for my handbag mirror for hours _ and it was just right here!"
,"There's nothing interesting inside"
,"It's just a wooden bedside table"
,"From here I can see the people walking in Corso Canalgrande"
,"I don't want to open it now"
,"It's a cozy bed"
,"Even if I'm tempted I don't want to go to sleep now"
,"This is the list of what Enrica needed _ to make the wand able to do the amber-liquifying trick: _ a dragon fragment _ a fragment of an animal never alive more than at least a thousand years old _ and a crow feather _ blue"
,"Good news _ she's already found the first two elements _ here in Modena _ with more time I'll explain to you what they are _ but we're still missing the blue crow feather"
,"I'll work on that _ then what?"
,"if we want to believe this instruction manual _ then we must stroke the wand with the feather and we're done _ the feather will burn if it's legit"
,"I'll work on my project _ as soon as we have understood what's going on"
,"Let's check the pictures on a bigger screen"
,"Nic's picture is really hi-res _ the gear scheme is well-visible and impressive"
,"The second picture he sent me shows more of the lateral part _ with the inscriptions _ that I think are not alphabet-based _ but directional _ a sort of instructions about how to handle the gear part"
,"I could try to make a program to check if this intuition works"
,"It could work _ I have the scheme to try _ let's print it for Marco"
,"if it is a sort of safe _ without a help _ it would be impossible to open it in years"
,"Uh _ the alphabet-like part is quite odd _ but there's only a part of it visible _ so I cannot understand what my sixth sense as a programmer suggests to me"
,"I'd need a more detailed view to be sure"
,"But I'd like to have a more detailed view of the inscriptions"
,"It's my MacBook _ I do all my stuff on it"
,"Marco, can you hear me from there?"
,"Yes"
,"Listen"
,"This is the list of what Enrica needed _ to make the wand able to do the amber-liquefying trick: _ a dragon fragment _ a fragment of an animal never alive more than at least a thousand years old _ and a crow feather _ blue"
,"Good news _ she's already found the first two elements _ here in Modena _ with more time I could ask here what they are _ but we're still missing the blue crow feather"
,"I should show these things to Marco and tell him"
,"There's the list of what Enrica was looking for here in Modena _ in theory to make the wand powerful"
,"She's still missing just the blue crow feather"
,"It's an ancient scroll _ it's written in Greek _ I can read some part of it _ classical lyceum rocks!"
,"There's just the burnt trace of the wand on the bed"
,"I don't want to touch it until I know what that does!"
,"It's a very old Harry-Potter-like wand _ there are fragments of I don't know what glued here and there"
,"I use it from my computer or my mobile phone _ not directly"
,"It's my quite expensive color printer"
,"It's an odd stick"
,"I'll take it when I know what it does"
,"It doesn't do anything _ no fire _ not even a little spark _ if it works may it really needs a blue feather"
,"It's an old piece of paper _ it's written in gibberish _ I can't read anything on it"
,"I can't read it"
,"It's Sara's MacBook _ I can just use Word on it"
,"I'm not in a hurry to write my article _ and that's the only thing I could do with it"
,"It's a fancy gadget"
,"Naah... I usually jam the paper just looking at it"
